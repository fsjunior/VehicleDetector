VehicleDetector

VehicleDetector is a experimental software for vehicle detection and tracking for "follow me" purpose. The detection is made with SURF feature detection algorithm.

It uses ROS (eletric) and Opencv.

This software is a pre-alpha version and isn't supposed that it will work on your computer. :)
